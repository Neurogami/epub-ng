<F4>epub-ng
===========

Beautiful, simple, elegant, powerful, easy, awesome, remarkable ePub file creation. No, really, I'm *serious*. 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Generates an ePub file from existing (x)html files and assets.

There are some notes in the code explaining stuff.

An ePub file is a zip file of book content + images + css, bundled up with some metadata files.

Creating the content is pretty easy (and likely more flexible to you) using something like Webby or Nanoc.

Once you have that then epub-ng will create the metadata files and package things for you.
